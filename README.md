## Controls

For the best experience, we recommend not reading past here before your
playthrough, or until you get stuck.

## Design Decisions

Okay, so it's also a metroidvania without powerups. The idea is that as you
explore, you see interactions in the game between its limited features that you
realise you can use in earlier areas to reach places you thought you would get a
powerup for. Not having health be an issue allowed the abuse of knockback from
getting hit as a full-blown puzzle mechanic. The absence of powerups hints
towards non-lime doors also being a utility instead of actual doors.
